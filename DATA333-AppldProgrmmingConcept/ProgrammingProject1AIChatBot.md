Scenario
========

A new marketing company is launching an Artificial Intelligence (AI) ChatBot for their website and want you to code a prototype demonstration for their investors. Simulate a "sales conversation" with a customer who will be purchasing licenses for your ChatBot service.

Your code must do the following:
--------------------------------

*Ask for the customer's first and last name. Store the values input to a variable.
*Greet your customer using their full name.
*Provide a few sentence overview of your Chatbot program. Be creative - make some stuff up. Output it to the screen with a nice format of your choice. Make this as serious or as silly a scenario as you want it to be. 
*Ask if your customer would like to make a purchase.
*If yes -- continue to the following items:
*Ask for their email address. Store the values input to a variable.
*Ask for their phone number.  Store the values input to a variable.
*Ask for how many chatbot licenses they would like to purchase. Store the values input to a variable.
*Ask if they would also like to purchase an optional Gold Support plan that gets them priority *support. 
*The Gold Support plan costs $500/year for license purchases 1 - 50.
*The Gold Support plan costs $350/year for license purchases 51 - 99.
*The Gold Support plan costs $250/year for license purchases 100+.
*Each chatbot license costs $75. Calculate and display their current total.  Store the values input to a variable.
*Apply 10% tax for the total bill. 
*Calculate the total amount due. Store the values input to a variable.
*Ask for a credit card number.  Store the values input to a variable.
*Ask for a credit card expiration date. Store the values input to a variable.
*Ask for a CVC number on the back of the credit card.  Store the values input to a variable.
*Ask for a zip code. Store the values input to a variable.
*Output a receipt using all of the variables you have input. Be sure to show the total license number, the amount for each license, the subtotal, tax, and total amount due. 
*In the receipt output, include the customer's name, phone number, email address, the credit card number, and expiration date.  
*If no - thank the customer by name and say goodbye. 
*Ask the customer if they would like to restart the ChatBot.
