Guess the number!
=================
For this practice lab, you will modify the Guess the Number! game. Use the example below as your starting point. In this practice, you have to do a bit of research yourself (this is a very important ability in your study and coding career) about generating a random number. I included it in the example below, but be sure to search for it, practice it, and understand it. 

Exercise 4.1 
------------
Define a function that can be reused later. 
Inside this function, ask for the player's name. Output their name at least once.
Inside this function, ask players if they would like to play an EASY, MODERATE, or HARD game.
easy = range of 1 to 10, limit tries to 5.
moderate = range of 1 to 100, limit tries to 8.
hard = range of 1 to 1000, limit tries to 10.
If the player doesn't guess the number in the required amount of tries, they lose the game.
Inside this function, keep track of the wins and losses for the player (using global variables), displaying the score before asking if they would like to play again.
